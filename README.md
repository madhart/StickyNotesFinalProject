# StickyNotesFinalProject
StickyNotes is the final project for my postsecondary course in Advanced JavaScript. My instructor provided base code with the following functionalities of sticky notes: add, edit, drag&drop, retrieve*, and export (download). 
* retrieve meaning to pull inspirational quotes from an API.

The finished project will have those functionalities listed above, as well as the additional functionalities of adding images to the notes, providing each note a date/time stamp, and sorting the notes (both ascending and descending options) by their creationdate. 

The languages included in this project are limited to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

The learning resources I will consult are the course textbook-- Murach's JavaScript and jQuery (4th Edition) written by Mary Delamater and Zak Ruvalcaba-- as well as w3schools.

Thank you for your interest in my project :).
